# 30-min-faux-meringue
A non-conventional rapid meringue recipe that results in a limited lifespan treat. (Warning - Uses magnesium)

## Ingredients

1 Egg white\
Powdered sifted sugar (25 gm)\
vanilla (4-5 drops)\
vinegar (2-3 drops)\
cream of tartar (1/8 tsp)\
Magnesium metal turnings - Grignard reagent grade (for dehydration)\
Electric beater

# Warning
Magnesium ignites at >500 °C and is fairly non-flammable, but burns hot (>2000 °C) and will explode if you put water on it - [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZhO98hjXqI). \
Do not use magnesium powder - it may disperse in a convection oven.\
Do not microwave metal.

## Theories (that seem to work well)
1. Magnesium acts as a desicant at high temperatures as it converts water into magnesium hydroxide
2. Vinegar will helps the hardening process go faster

## Recipie

1. Put 1 small bowl of magnesium turnings into the oven and preheat to 180°C. This will decrease the humidity of the oven
2. Add 1 egg white and 1/8 tsp cream of tartar to a large bowl.
3. Beat until stiff peaks
4. Set the oven to 120°C preheat
5. Add sugar (25 gm), vanilla extract(4-5 drops) and vinegar (2-3 drops) and beat until glossy
6. Put small portions of resulting foam on a plate, place in the oven and bake at 110°C for 10 min and then 100°C for 20 min
7. Take out of oven and place in freezer immediately for 2 min to cool rapidly
8. Take out of freezer and consume within 5 min while still crispy.
9. These fax meringues become soggy rapidly and only stay crispy for a short time - even if stored in an airtight sealed container.
